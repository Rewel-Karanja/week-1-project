# **Being a Product Data Scientist at Instagram**

If I were a Product Data Scientist at Instagram, I would measure the success of the Instagram TV product using a variety of metrics, including:

**Views** : This is the most basic metric, but it is still important to track how many people are watching IGTV videos.
 Average view time: This metric tells me how long people are watching IGTV videos on average. This is important because it gives me an idea of how engaging the content is.

**Audience retention** : This metric tells me what percentage of viewers watch an IGTV video from start to finish. This is important because it gives me an idea of how well the content is able to keep people's attention.

**Engagement rate** : This metric tells me what percentage of viewers interact with an IGTV video by liking, commenting, or sharing it. This is important because it gives me an idea of how much people are enjoying the content.

**Follower growth** : This metric tells me how many new followers IGTV is attracting. This is important because it gives me an idea of how popular the product is becoming.

I would also track metrics that are specific to the goals of Instagram TV. For example, if one of the goals of IGTV is to help creators build audiences, I would track metrics such as the number of new followers that creators are gaining and the average growth rate of creators' followings.

In addition to tracking these metrics, I would also use qualitative data to measure the success of IGTV. For example, I would conduct surveys and interviews with users to get their feedback on the product. I would also monitor social media and online forums to see what people are saying about IGTV.

By tracking a variety of quantitative and qualitative metrics, I would be able to get a holistic view of how well IGTV is performing and identify areas where the product can be improved.

Here are some specific examples of how I would use the metrics listed above to measure the success of IGTV:

1. I would compare the average view time of IGTV videos to the average view time of other video content on Instagram, such as Reels and Stories. This would help me to understand how engaging IGTV content is compared to other types of content on the platform.
2. I would track the audience retention rate of IGTV videos over time. This would help me to identify trends and see how well IGTV content is able to keep people's attention.
3. I would compare the engagement rate of IGTV videos to the engagement rate of other video content on Instagram. This would help me to understand how engaging IGTV content is compared to other types of content on the platform.
4. I would track the follower growth of IGTV users over time. This would help me to understand how popular IGTV is becoming and whether it is helping creators to build audiences.
5. I would conduct surveys and interviews with users to get their feedback on IGTV. This would help me to understand what users like and dislike about the product, as well as identify areas where the product can be improved.
6. I would monitor social media and online forums to see what people are saying about IGTV. This would help me to identify trends and understand how users are perceiving the product.

By tracking and analyzing a variety of metrics, I would be able to get a comprehensive understanding of the success of IGTV and identify areas where the product can be improved.
